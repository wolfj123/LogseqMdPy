# LogseqMdPy

A Python library designed to help you efficiently manage and manipulate your Logseq graphs. Provides tools and utilities for working with Logseq's markdown-based system.

I recently discovered [another library the does similar things](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/LogseqMarkdownParser), so if this one doesn't satisfy you maybe check out [LogseqMarkdownParser](https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/LogseqMarkdownParser)!
